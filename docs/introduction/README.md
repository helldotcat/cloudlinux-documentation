### CloudLinux OS Solo
CloudLinux OS Solo is designed for installation on VPS or VDS servers.
This edition has major differences compared to all others, so please make sure to carefully examine the feature table to see if it is suitable for you
[here](/introduction/).


### CloudLinux OS Admin

CloudLinux OS Admin is designed for shared hosting providers who want to flawlessly migrate their
big shared hosting customer to individual VPS with same CloudLinux features as on Shared hosting.
At the same time you will be able to separate such a user's websites if necessary and isolate them
with CageFS for efficient extra security.
Also it may be suitable for a small server with less than 5 customers on it.

Most of the features of CloudLinux OS Shared are available in this edition, with a small differences:

- lve limits are set to unlimited by default (can be changed in CloudLinux Manager at any time)
- MySQL Governor is not available in this edition
- the license itself does not allow more than 5 users to be hosted on server.

### CloudLinux OS Shared (Pro)

CloudLinux OS Shared is designed for shared hosting providers.
It isolates each customer into a separate “Lightweight Virtualized Environment” (LVE),
which allocates and limits server resources, like memory, CPU and the number of simultaneous connections,
for each web hosting tenant. This ensures that tenants cannot jeopardize the stability of your servers,
causing all sites to slow down or even come to a halt. CloudLinux OS Shared also “cages” tenants from one another
to avoid security breaches. This way, unstable scripts or malware are not able to sprawl across your customer sites,
causing severe harm.

Purchasing CloudLinux OS Shared Pro license extends your CloudLinux OS Shared
functionality with even more useful [features](/shared-pro/introduction/).


## CloudLinux OS components

**CloudLinux Manager**

LVE is a Lightweight Virtualized Environment.
CloudLinux Manager allows you to maintain fine-tuned control over your resources,
including CPU, IO rate, memory, inodes, numbers of processes, and concurrent connections,
that any single account can use. Now you can limit resource abuse, while allowing good customers to use what they need.

[See more](/shared/lve_manager/).

**CageFS**

CageFS is a virtualized, per-user file system that uniquely encapsulates each customer,
preventing users from seeing each other and viewing sensitive information. CageFS prevents a large number of attacks,
including most privilege escalation and information disclosure attacks. It is completely transparent to your customers,
without any need for them to change their scripts.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#cagefs).

**MySQL Governor**

:::tip Note
This component is not available in the CloudLinux OS Admin edition.
:::

MySQL Governor tracks CPU and disk IO usage for every user in real time and throttles MySQL queries by using LVE limits. By using the [dbtop](/command-line_tools/#dbtop) utility, it is possible to see the database usage on a per-customer basis, ensuring that the system admin always know what is going on.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#mysql-governor).

**PHP Selector**

PHP Selector allows end users to select the specific version of PHP they need. It allows ultimate flexibility by offering all
popular versions of PHP, with more than 120 PHP extensions to choose from.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#php-selector).

**Ruby Selector**

Ruby Selector allows end users to choose the Ruby version for applications and install additional modules
to the application environment. Ruby Selector uses `mod_passenger` for delivering optimum performance.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#ruby-selector).

**Python Selector**

Python Selector allows end users to choose the Python version for applications and install additional modules.
Python Selector uses `mod_passenger` to get the best performance from Python applications.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#python-selector).

**Node.js Selector**

Node.js Selector is a CloudLinux OS Shared component that allows each user to easily create Node.js applications,
choose Node.js versions and other parameters for applications based on their needs.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#node-js-selector).

**Apache mod_lsapi PRO**

Mod_lsapi PRO is the fastest PHP handler for Apache. It is a drop-in replacement for SuPHP, FCGID, RUID2, and ITK.
It has a low memory footprint and understands `.htaccess` PHP directives.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#apache-mod-lsapi-pro).

**Reseller limits**

Reseller limits is a feature that allows hosters to set limits for the resources each Reseller can operate with.
The server admin also provides controls on what resources each end user will have. Reseller limits set by a hoster
limit the total amount of resources resellers’ end users can consume altogether.

When a hoster has set reseller limits for the particular reseller he provides the reseller with an ability to
set limits for his end users within the Reseller Interface.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#reseller-limits).

**LVE-stats 2**

LVE-stats 2 collects LVE usage statistics (CPU, memory, disk space usage),
and allows to collect the usage data.

[See more](/shared/cloudlinux_os_components/#lve-stats-2).

:::tip Note!
Starting from v11.116.0.1, cPanel is fully integrated with CloudLinux 9 (9.2+), and the flag `--experimental-os=almalinux-9.2` no longer necessary.
:::

:::tip Note!
If you have a server with cPanel + CloudLinux already installed via the experimental flag `--experimental-os=almalinux-9.2`, as described here, it is highly recommended to reinstall the server from scratch to avoid unexpected behavior.
